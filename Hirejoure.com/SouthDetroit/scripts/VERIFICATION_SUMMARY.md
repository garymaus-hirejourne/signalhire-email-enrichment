# Email Format Verification System - Comprehensive Summary

## User's Critical Findings

### Bureau Veritas (from Google search)
- **US Region**: `First.Last@us.bureauveritas.com` (98% of US contacts)
- **Global**: `first.last@bureauveritas.com` (69.5% globally)
- **Variations**: `FLast@us.bureauveritas.com`, `Fir.Last@us.bureauveritas.com`

### UL.com (from Google search)
- **Dominant**: `john.doe@ul.com` (first.last@ul.com)
- **Variations**: `j.doe@ul.com` (f.last@ul.com), `doe.john@ul.com` (last.first@ul.com)
- **Note**: Uses base domain (ul.com), NOT regional subdomains

## Key Insights

1. **Each domain has UNIQUE patterns** - no global rules apply
2. **Regional vs base domains vary by company** - Bureau Veritas uses regional, UL uses base
3. **Pattern frequency matters** - dominant patterns vs variations with percentages
4. **Manual verification is most reliable** - automated searches miss critical details

## Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Framework for domain-specific verification** - built and tested
- **Regional domain detection capability** - can handle us.bureauveritas.com
- **Known patterns database** - expandable with verified data
- **Domain mapping logic** - routes to correct regional domains
- **Comprehensive fallback system** - Hunter.io, search, scraping, known patterns

### ❌ Current Limitations
- **Search engine blocking** - automated queries don't find specific pattern data
- **Limited known patterns** - need more manual research results
- **No pattern frequency analysis** - missing dominant vs variation logic
- **No confidence scoring** - can't prioritize patterns by reliability

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Expand Known Patterns Database
Based on manual Google searches for each domain in the dataset:
- mistrasgroup.com
- dnvgl.com  
- tuvsud.com
- Any other domains in future datasets

### 2. Implement Pattern Frequency Logic
- Dominant pattern (highest frequency)
- Variation patterns (lower frequency)
- Confidence scoring based on source reliability

### 3. Add Manual Research Integration
- Easy way to add verified patterns from Google searches
- Documentation of pattern sources and confidence levels
- Regular updates as companies change email formats

## Impact on Email Generation

### Before (Global Assumptions)
- Bureau Veritas: `first.last@bureauveritas.com` ❌
- UL: `first.last@ul.com` ✅ (accidentally correct)

### After (Domain-Specific Verification)
- Bureau Veritas: `First.Last@us.bureauveritas.com` ✅ (98% accuracy)
- UL: `john.doe@ul.com` ✅ (verified dominant pattern)

## Conclusion

The email format verification system now has the **framework** for accurate, domain-specific verification. The key to maximum accuracy is combining this framework with **manual research results** from Google searches for each specific domain.

**Manual verification + automated framework = Maximum email deliverability**
